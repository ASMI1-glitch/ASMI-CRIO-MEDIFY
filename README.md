# Getting Started with Medify

Welcome to the Medify project! This application was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and is designed to provide a seamless experience for managing your health data.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes, and you may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.  
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point, you're on your own.

You don't have to use `eject` unless you're ready to customize your configuration. The curated feature set is suitable for small and medium deployments.

## Project Structure

This project follows a structured layout to ensure maintainability and scalability. Hereâ€™s an overview of the key directories:

- **src/**: Contains all the source code for the application.
  - **components/**: Contains reusable React components.
  - **assets/**: Contains images, icons, and other static resources.
  - **styles/**: Contains global styles and CSS modules.
  
- **public/**: Contains static files like `index.html`.
